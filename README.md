Solidity smart contract for the creation of a "piggy bank" style savings account.

Users can define a savings target and an end date. They can proceed to transfer eth to the piggy bank when within their timeframe. They can withdraw the eth they have added when one of two conditions are met: 1) they have reached their savings target or 2) the timeframe specified has ended.



Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
